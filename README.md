# Tic-Tac-Toe
"Tic-Tac-Toe" is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O." Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell, aiming to align three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
